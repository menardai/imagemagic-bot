Resize these 2 pics like the previous ones
Change the size of these 2 jpeg
Make the same change on the 3 other pictures
1 of the sides are incorrect
Can I resize 2 pictures at once?
How can we change the size of 2 png images?
How do I upload more than 1 image at the time?

Please repeat the last 2 steps

No, height=480 not 2
The 2 is bad, the height should be 480

This is not the width, 480 is the height
The width you have is wrong, width is 640

Change it to 640x480 from the current 2x2
Go from a 2x2 to a 640x480
